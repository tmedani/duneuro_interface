- test the process on the linux machine
- test MEG
- add plot of the electric field

- recompile the duneuro cpp with the release opts
- parrallelisation of the computation // use multi thread

- segmentqtion with fieltrip pipline ==> interessant et rapide
- MEG computation

- generate hexa mesh
- write the hexa files for duneruo 
- display hexa mesh

- which model is better ... tetra or hexamodel

add function to bst FEM model to extract the FEM mesh surfaces

- Mix between the roast segmentation and johannes hexamesh generator
- conert tetrq to hexa et visversa
-add header and help for all functions

- Check the MEG with and witout outer layers.

- Oprimisation ... writer functions = : dipoles, electrodes, coils , orijections could be combined in one function

- there is probably an error on the way to export the lf_meg ... check with Juan- work on the EEG/MEG combined method is the head is not all considered.
